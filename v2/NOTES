In WaitInput,
	If syntax checking is flawless, do _asm { hlt }
	
	If window location is different, or syntax changed,
	render entire screen.
	
	Place cursor on the right spot.
	Note special save-restore handling for soft-cursor.

In StatusRenderTop(), needs MarioTranslate(&Hdr[0], GetVidMem(0,0), VidW)
